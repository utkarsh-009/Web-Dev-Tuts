    <!-- Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. -->
    <!-- For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. 
        This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are, 
        and browsers know how to display them. -->
    <p>
        <!-- Example:  -->
    <details>
        <!--  The contents of the <summary> element are used as the label for the disclosure widget. -->
        <summary> Info </summary>
        Summary Tag used
    </details>
    <!-- NOTE: Summary is just a label. You can use anyother name besides summary. If not used it uses "Details" as default-->
